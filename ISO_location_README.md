### Overview

This is the reference environment for the manuscript ['Hormonal regulation of salt and water excretion: a mathematical model of whole-kidney function and pressure-natriuresis'](http://dx.doi.org/10.1152/ajprenal.00089.2013) (Moss R & Thomas SR. Am J Physiol Renal Physiol, 2014.).  It executes code to reproduce specific results described in the manuscript.   You can find more information about this research at the [project page here](http://robmoss.github.io/model/rfc/).  

To find other versions of this reference environment, see Other Links below.  To learn more about reference environments, [see the detailed description here](http://uomsystemsbiology.github.io/reference-environments/).  

### Instructions for use

This version of the reference environment is a live image as a bootable read-only ISO.  To use it:

- Install a virtualization tool like [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/), then 
- Create a new virtual machine in the virtualization tool with a virtual CD/DVD-ROM drive
- Mount the ISO in the drive
- Boot the machine.  

This will start a virtual machine with scripts to run which reproduce results described in the manuscript.
