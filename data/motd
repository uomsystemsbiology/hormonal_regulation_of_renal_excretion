### Overview

This is the reference environment for the manuscript ['Hormonal regulation of salt and water excretion: a mathematical model of whole-kidney function and pressure-natriuresis'](http://dx.doi.org/10.1152/ajprenal.00089.2013) (Moss R & Thomas SR. Am J Physiol Renal Physiol, 2014.).  It executes code to reproduce specific results described in the manuscript.   You can find more information about this research at the [project page here](http://robmoss.github.io/model/rfc/).  

To find other versions of this reference environment, see Other Links below.  To learn more about reference environments, [see the detailed description here](http://uomsystemsbiology.github.io/reference-environments/).  

### Instructions for use

To use this version of the reference environment you will need a display, so you cannot execute the scripts by sshing into the environment.  To get an environment with a display, use the bootable ISO or Vagrant-managed virtual machine versions of the environment described below.
